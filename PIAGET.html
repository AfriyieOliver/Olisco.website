<BR>
<B><h1>BRIEF HISTORY</h1></B>
Jean Piaget, a Swiss psychologist was particularly concerned with the way thinking develops in 
children from birth till they become young adults. To understand the nature of this development, 
Piaget carefully observed the behaviour of his own three kids. He used to present problems to 
them, observe responses slightly after the situations and again observe their responses. Piaget 
called this method of exploring development clinical interview.

<h><b>Stages of cognitive development.</B></h>
<br>
Piaget has identified 4 sequential stages through which every individual progresses in 
cognitive development. Each stage has an age span with distinctive learning capabilities. This 
would be helpful in framing curriculum. And understanding of this development sequence is 
indispensable for parents as well as for teachers because these influences a great deal during 
infancy, childhood and adolescence. 

<b>The 4 developmental stages are discussed below</B>
<Br>
<br>
<B>1. Sensori-Motor Stage.</B>
<br>
<img src="s2.jpeg" width="200" height="200">
<br>

<br> This stage begins at birth and lasts till the child is about 2 years old. 
<font color="blue">It is called Sensori-Motor Stage,</font> because children’s thinking involves seeing, hearing, 
moving, touching, testing and so on. This stage marks a transitional stage for a person 
from a biological to a psychological being. <font color="blue">In the first few weeks of life the baby’s 
behaviour consists simply of reflex responses,such as sucking, stepping, and grasping.</font> 
Later the reflex disappears and the baby chooses what and when to grasp.
During this period the infants attain the <b>concept of object permenance.</B> This refers to 
the understanding that objects and events continue to exist even when they cannot 
directly be seen, heard or touched. Till this kind of understanding is achieved, an object 
that is out of sight remains out of mind and therefore, becomes non-existent. 
<font color="blue">A second major accomplishment in the Sensori-Motor period is learning to reverse 
actions.</font> E.g., we give a toy to a child that has ten detachable parts. We detach all parts. 
Through trial and error, the child gradually learns to attach all the parts of the toy.
<br>
<br>


<H>2.<b>Pre-Operational Stage (2 to 7 Years).</H></B>
<br>
<img src="p1.jpeg" width="200" height="200">
<br>


 This stage is called Pre-Operational because the 
children have not yet mastered the ability to perform mental operations. Children’s 
thinking during this stage is governed by what is seen rather than by logical principles. 
<br>
<br>
<B><font color="blue">Following are the accomplishments of Pre-Operational Stage:</font></B>
<br>
<br>
<font color="orange">a. Semantic function.</font> 
<BR>
During this stage the child develops the ability to think using 
symbols and signs. Symbols represent something or someone else; for example, a 
doll may symbolize a baby, child or an adult.
<br>
<br>
<font color="orange">b. Egocentrism. </font>
<br>
This stage is characterized by egocentrism. Children believe that their 
way of thinking is the only way to think.
<br>
<br>
<font color="orange">c. Decentering.</font>
<br> A pre-operational child has difficulty in seeing more than one 
dimension or aspects of situation. It is called decentering.
<br>
<br>
<font color="orange">d. Animism.</font> Children tend to refer to inanimate objects as if they have life-like 
qualities and are capable of actions.
<br>
<br>
<font color="orange">e. Seriation.</font> 
<br>
They lack the ability of classification or grouping objects into categories.
<br>
<br>
<font color="orange">f. Conservation.</font> 
<br>
It refers to the understanding that certain properties of an object 
remain the same despite a change in their appearance.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<font color="blue">3. Concrete Operational Stage (7 to 11 years).</font>
<br>
<br>
<img src="c1.jpg" width="550" height="300">
<br>
<br>
 At this stage a child is concerned with the 
<font color="blue">integration of stability of his cognitive systems.</font> He learns to 
add, subtract, multiply and 
divide. <font color="blue">He is in a position to classify concrete objects.</font> 

In short, children develop the 
abilities of rational thinking but their thinking is tied to concrete objects.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
4. Formal Operational Stage (11 & above).
<br>
<br>
<img src="f1.png" width="300" height="200"> 

<br>
<br>
<br>
This type is characterised by <font color="blue">the emergence of 
logical thinking and reasoning.</font> Other important cognitive attainments during this period 
are: <font color="blue">the ability to think about the hypothetical possibilities and to solve problems through 
logical deductions and in a systematic
